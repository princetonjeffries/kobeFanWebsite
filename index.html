        <h2>In Memorial of Kobe Bean Bryant</h2>
        <p id="paragraph1">Kobe Bryant was one of the most influential basketball players ever. He touched the heart of inspired many people. Kobe was a perfect example of how hardwork can bring you anything you want. In January of 2020, tragedy struck, and a helicopter crash caused the world to lose the beloved 'Black Mamba' along with his daughter Gianna and 7 others(see <a href="https://time.com/5772382/kobe-bryant-helicopter-crash-victims/">here</a> for victims).</p>
        <p>This fan page was created for people to look back on the legacy and greatness that was Kobe Bryant. This website highlights his successes, legacy, and pictures to remember the late, great Black Mamba.</p>
